# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by James Vinh

First, Zinsser advises Simplicity. Strip unnecessary words. They weaken your writingâ€™s understandability. How can you help your reader? Through clear thinking and careful writing. Construct sentences precisely. Stay consistent with pronouns and tenses. Before submission, rewrite and read aloud your work. Simplification creates clarity. 

Second, eliminate clutter: words that do not serve any purpose. Delete unnecessary adjectives. Replace long phrases with short words that communicate the same meaning. No fad terms. Fight jargon with concise, clear explanations. Place brackets around superfluous words in your writing to see if they are necessary.

Writing well is hard. Good writing is no accident.
